# .NET embedding of Wasmtime

[Wasmtime](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime) is a standalone runtime for [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/), using the Cranelift JIT compiler.

The [.NET embedding of Wasmtime](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime-dotnet) enables .NET code to instantiate WebAssembly modules and to interact with them in-process.
